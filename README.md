# petersPortfolio-HW2

A portfolio website that displays information about me, my work, and contact information.

This is an example of a portfolio website with responsive layout.

- Avatar and links at the top will navigate to various sections or pages of the website.
- Hovering over images and links will display a fading effect, with links having an animated fading effect.
- Clicking on images will take you to different pages linked to the main site.
- Clicking on contact links at the bottom with take the user to the appropriate page. Clicking on phone will initiate a prompt to call.
- Resizing a screen width less than 1000px will activate a media query to resize the header to prevent nav links from wraping
- Resizing the screen should have no effect on arrangment of other elements on the page

A screenshot of the site is in the "assets" folder.
