          <h3>App Description</h3>
          BeerMe International is an app designed to provide you with a random
          beer suggestion based of a clients input of alcohol content and
          desired bitterness. This was inspired by the need to find a new beer
          without having the benifit of suggestions from social situations
          during times of social distancing and fewer opportunities to eat out.

          <h3>How It Works</h3>
          Useage is simple and fairly straight forward. Once you have navigated
          to the website (https://tjcourey.github.io/beerMe-international/) via
          computer or mobile device, you can select the alcohol content and
          bitterness via sliders and search for a beer. Alternatively you can
          select a completely random beer. Once you have searched for a beer it
          will be displayed to the page along with some information from the
          brewer as well as a fun way to order the beer.
